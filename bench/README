GCC works. But Clang has some problems. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

========== ping-pong ==========

`ping` is a client.
`pong` is a server.

Usage:
pong <port> <threads> <blocksize> <sessions>
ping <port> <threads> <blocksize> <sessions> <timeout(s)>

Example:
./build/pong 8848 5 16384 50
./build/ping 8848 5 16384 50 5

Note:
`pong_asio` is also a server but it uses Asio. You can use it to compare performance.
